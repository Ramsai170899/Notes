# PySpark Project Ideas

Welcome to a collection of PySpark project ideas ranging from basic to advanced levels. These projects cover various domains and complexities, allowing you to explore PySpark's capabilities.

## Basic Level Projects

### Data Exploration and Cleaning
Use PySpark to explore and clean a dataset, handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

### Word Count Application
Implement a basic word count application using PySpark on a large text dataset.

### Data Aggregation and Analysis
Aggregate and analyze data from a CSV or JSON file using PySpark's DataFrame operations.

## Intermediate Level Projects

### Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data
Perform sentiment analysis on a dataset collected from Twitter using PySpark. Analyze trends, sentiments, and word frequencies.

### E-commerce Product Recommendation System
Build a recommendation system using collaborative filtering or ALS (Alternating Least Squares) algorithm on PySpark, utilizing purchase history or user behavior data.

### Predictive Analytics - Regression or Classification
Create a machine learning model using PySpark's MLlib for regression or classification tasks. For example, predict housing prices or classify customer churn.

## Advanced Level Projects

### Real-time Stream Processing
Implement a streaming application with PySpark using technologies like Kafka, Apache Spark Structured Streaming, and perform analytics on incoming data streams.

### Large-Scale Graph Processing
Work on a graph analytics project using PySpark's GraphFrames to analyze large-scale graph data, like social networks or network traffic data.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP) on Big Text Data
Apply NLP techniques using PySpark on a large corpus of text data for tasks like topic modeling, text summarization, or named entity recognition.

### Custom Machine Learning Pipelines
Build custom ML pipelines using PySpark's Pipeline API, incorporating feature engineering, model training, and hyperparameter tuning for complex machine learning tasks.

These project ideas cover a range of complexities and application domains.
